I am a passionate, conscientious programmer.
I value reliability at all levels of software development.
I try to understand my software down to the machine so that I can make informed decicions about the engineering implications.
I use up-to-date technologies only because they solve real problems, not just because it's new and shiny.
My pronouns are she/they.

## My Work

I'm going to be honest: decades of depression and dissociation wreck havoc on a person.
I've lost track of so much work that I've done, and I'm reassembling it all, this time with some code to help me manage it.
